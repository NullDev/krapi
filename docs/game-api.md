title: Game API
description: The endpoints the Krunker client reads without any authentication
---

These are the endpoints the game itself calls without a developer key and without a player token: the social popup, the clan window, Turf Wars, the market tab, the shop, the matchmaker and the two legacy browsers. Nothing here is documented by Krunker. Every endpoint, parameter and field below was taken from the game's client code and confirmed with a plain, unauthenticated `GET` in October 2026. All of it can change without notice.

In krapio these live under `krunker.game.*`, grouped by resource. Everything is read only: every write the game makes (follows, posts, purchases, listings, trades, clan management) needs the player's own token and is not part of this library.

## Hosts and envelopes

| Host | Used by | Reply shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://gapi.svc.krunker.io` | everything unless noted | `{"data": ..., "error": null}`; an error is `{"error": {"code", "message"}}` on a 404 or `{"error": "text"}` on a 400 |
| `https://matchmaker.krunker.io` | `matchmaker.*` | plain JSON, no envelope |
| `https://api.krunker.io` | `legacy.*` | plain JSON, `streams/top` wraps in `{"data"}` |

krapio unwraps the envelope, you get `data`. A non-null `error` on a 2xx (never seen, but the game checks for it) throws `KrunkerError`.

**Rate limits.** `gapi.svc.krunker.io` sends `X-RateLimit-Limit: 5`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` on every reply: a window of 5 requests per second per endpoint, with `X-RateLimit-Reset` as seconds until the window ends (not a unix timestamp like the developer API). krapio waits out an empty window instead of refusing, since it is over within a second. The matchmaker and `api.krunker.io` send no rate limit headers.

**Names.** Player and clan name lookups are case-insensitive. Names go url-encoded into the path.

---

## Players

The social profile popup and its tabs.

### Get Player

```http
GET /players/:name
```

`krunker.game.players.get(playerName)`

The flat legacy profile the social popup renders. 404 `PLAYERS_NOT_FOUND` for an unknown name.

```ts
type PlayerSocialProfile = {
    player_id: number;
    player_name: string;
    player_clan?: string;          // absent without a clan
    clan_id?: number;
    player_twitchname: string;
    player_region: number;
    player_badge: string;          // comma separated badge ids
    player_titles: string;         // comma separated title ids
    player_datenew: string;        // "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
    player_featured: number;
    player_funds: number;          // kr
    player_skinvalue: number;
    player_elo: number;
    player_elo2: number;
    player_elo4: string;           // junk rating, a decimal as text
    player_premium: number;
    player_kills: number;
    player_deaths: number;
    player_wins: number;
    player_games_played: number;
    player_score: number;
    player_timeplayed: number;     // seconds
    player_following: number;
    player_followed: number;
    player_chal: number;
    player_infected: number;
    player_jobrating: number;
    player_jobratingpositive: number;
    player_calls: number;
    player_taggedaccounts: number;
    player_stats: PlayerStats;
    online: number;
    maps: unknown[];
    mods: unknown[];
    assets: unknown[];
    match_history: MatchHistoryGame[];   // only ever seen empty, shape from the game code
    ranked_rank: number;
    raid_stats: RaidStats[];
};
```

`player_stats` is a packed blob with short keys. The developer API's player profile has the same numbers under full names.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| s, h, hs, ls, wb | shots, hits, headshots, legshots, wallbangs |
| mk, fk, tmk | melee kills, fist kills (beatdowns), thrown weapon kills (bullseyes) |
| ast, n, ad, sad | assists, nukes, airdrops, airdrops stolen |
| sl, wm | slimes, warmachines |
| flg | country flag index |
| hds | 1 when the profile hides details |
| c0 to c15 | score per class |

`raid_stats` rows are `{map_id, completions, attempts, best_time, ai_kills, boss_kills, deaths}`.

### Search Players

```http
GET /players/search?q=:query&limit=:limit
```

`krunker.game.players.search(query, limit = 5)`

Prefix match on the name, `limit` 1 to 20. Returns `{player_id, player_name, player_score}[]` (krapio unwraps the `results` key).

```

`krunker.game.players.sales(playerName, range = 3)`

One row per day with market sales: `{f, t, d}[]` where `f` is kr earned, `t` items sold, `d` the day as `YYYY-MM-DD`. The popup sends `range=3`.

### Get Player Listings

```http
GET /players/:name/listings
```

`krunker.game.players.listings(playerName)`

Only ever answered `[]`. The developer API's player listings endpoint has the real data.

### Get Followers and Following

GET /players/:name/following
```

`krunker.game.players.followers(playerName)`, `krunker.game.players.following(playerName)`

```http
GET /social/feed?player_id=:id&limit=:limit
```

    clan_banner_color: string;     // "s<n>" = paint shader n, otherwise a color
    creator_name: string;
    members: ClanPublicMember[];
};

type ClanPublicMember = {
    p: string;      // name
    s: number;      // score

### Clan Leaderboard

```http

100 rows of `{position, clan_name, clan_score, member_count, hack_count}`.

```

`krunker.game.leaderboards.raidsMonthly(mapId, month, sort?)`

`month` is required, as `YYYY-MM` (what the game sends). A bare number like `8` is also answered, with different rows of unknown meaning, so krapio only accepts `YYYY-MM`. A month without runs answers `{"data": null}`, which krapio returns as `[]`.
